The HashiCorp HCL Extension for Visual Studio Code (VS Code) adds syntax highlighting for <a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/">HCL</a> files.

## Quick Start

1. Install the extension from the [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hashicorp.hcl)
1. Open your desired workspace and/or the root folder containing your HCL files.

## Features

This extension will provide syntax highlighting for all HashiCorp products that use `.hcl` as the file extension:

- HCL
- Boundary
- Nomad
- Packer
- Waypoint

HCL is a toolkit for creating structured configuration languages that are both human- and machine-friendly, for use with command-line tools. HCL provides a set of constructs that can be used by a calling application to construct a configuration language. Most HashiCorp products use implementations of HCL for their configuration language.
